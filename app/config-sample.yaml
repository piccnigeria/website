# This config is divided into 3 environments, namely *, development and production
# *: holds configuration parameters that are the same in both development and production,
#    so you don't have to declare these twice
# development: holds configuration parameters that are applicable to only the development environment
# production: configuration parameters that are applicable to only the production environment
